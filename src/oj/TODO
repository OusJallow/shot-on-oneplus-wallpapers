1. Thread heavy tasks
    * Image and Website retrieval
    * Fitter
    * Setter

2. Add Metadata to images for future purposes (see TODO 2)
 using Adobe Commons Imaging

3. Append Image Data (as JSON maybe) to Wallpaper before saving.
   So it can be retrieved and reused for wallpaper slideshow  and etc
